# SQL - SUBQUERY and WITH



## Teoria

1) Consulta sobre consulta(s).
2) Lembrar de fazer por partes.
3) Precisa ter um código limpo e perfeitamente e identado para compreender facilmente.
3) Pode ser do tipo aninhada ou interna.
4) A subqueries não são a forma mais limpa, os Temp Tables com WITH são.
5) WITH is Common Table Expression or CTE, são mais comuns na prática


## Exercícios

###SUBQUERY

1) First, we needed to group by the day and channel. Then ordering by the number of events (the third column) gave us a quick way to answer the first question.


```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
   channel, COUNT(*) as events
FROM web_events
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

2) Here you can see that to get the entire table in question 1 back, we included an * in our SELECT statement. You will need to be sure to alias your table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
           channel, COUNT(*) as events
     FROM web_events 
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;
```

3) Finally, here we are able to get a table that shows the average number of events a day for each channel.

Aninhada
```sql
SELECT channel, AVG(events) AS average_events
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
             channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2) sub
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

## The Best Identaton

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
                channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2
      ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub
GROUP BY day, channel, events
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

4) Here is the necessary quiz to pull the first month/year combo from the orders table.

```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) 
FROM orders;
```

5) Then to pull the average for each, we could do this all in one query, but for readability, I provided two queries below to perform each separately.

Interna
```sql
SELECT AVG(standard_qty) avg_std, AVG(gloss_qty) avg_gls, AVG(poster_qty) avg_pst
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
     (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);

SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd)
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
      (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);
```

6) Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount of total_amt_usd sales.

First, I wanted to find the total_amt_usd totals associated with each sales rep, and I also wanted the region in which they were located. The query below provided this information.
```sql
SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

```
7) Next, I pulled the max for each region, and then we can use this to pull those rows in our final result.

```sql
SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
     GROUP BY 1;
```
8) Essentially, this is a JOIN of these two tables, where the region and amount match.

```sql
SELECT t3.rep_name, t3.region_name, t3.total_amt
FROM(SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
     GROUP BY 1) t2
JOIN (SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
     FROM sales_reps s
     JOIN accounts a
     ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
     JOIN orders o
     ON o.account_id = a.id
     JOIN region r
     ON r.id = s.region_id
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) t3
ON t3.region_name = t2.region_name AND t3.total_amt = t2.total_amt;
```

### WITH

1) Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount of total_amt_usd sales.

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
  SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
   FROM sales_reps s
   JOIN accounts a
   ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
   JOIN orders o
   ON o.account_id = a.id
   JOIN region r
   ON r.id = s.region_id
   GROUP BY 1,2
   ORDER BY 3 DESC), 
t2 AS (
   SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
   FROM t1
   GROUP BY 1)
SELECT t1.rep_name, t1.region_name, t1.total_amt
FROM t1
JOIN t2
ON t1.region_name = t2.region_name AND t1.total_amt = t2.total_amt;
```

2) For the region with the largest sales total_amt_usd, how many total orders were placed?

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
   SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
   FROM sales_reps s
   JOIN accounts a
   ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
   JOIN orders o
   ON o.account_id = a.id
   JOIN region r
   ON r.id = s.region_id
   GROUP BY r.name), 
t2 AS (
   SELECT MAX(total_amt)
   FROM t1)
SELECT r.name, COUNT(o.total) total_orders
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (SELECT * FROM t2);
```
3) For the account that purchased the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) standard_qty paper, how many accounts still had more in total purchases?
```sql
WITH t1 AS (
  SELECT a.name account_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) total_std, SUM(o.total) total
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON o.account_id = a.id
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC
  LIMIT 1), 
t2 AS (
  SELECT a.name
  FROM orders o
  JOIN accounts a
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total FROM t1))
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM t2;
```
4) For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) total_amt_usd, how many web_events did they have for each channel?
```sql
WITH t1 AS (
   SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
   FROM orders o
   JOIN accounts a
   ON a.id = o.account_id
   GROUP BY a.id, a.name
   ORDER BY 3 DESC
   LIMIT 1)
SELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*)
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id AND a.id =  (SELECT id FROM t1)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

5) What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for the top 10 total spending accounts?

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
   SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
   FROM orders o
   JOIN accounts a
   ON a.id = o.account_id
   GROUP BY a.id, a.name
   ORDER BY 3 DESC
   LIMIT 10)
SELECT AVG(tot_spent)
FROM t1;
```

6) What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd, including only the companies that spent more per order, on average, than the average of all orders.

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
   SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
   FROM orders o
   JOIN accounts a
   ON a.id = o.account_id),
t2 AS (
   SELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_amt
   FROM orders o
   GROUP BY 1
   HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT * FROM t1))
SELECT AVG(avg_amt)
FROM t2;
```
